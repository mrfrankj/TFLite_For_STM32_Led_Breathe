The stm32 project use the tensorflow lite trained algorithm model, to realize the led breathe functionality.
so, we need to use tensorflow to train a specific algorithm model firstly, then convert it to tensorflow lite model, 
and then deploy it to the stm32 project, to achieve AI functionality on terminal devices.
